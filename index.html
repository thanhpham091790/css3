        In the paragraph above, the div element is 120 pixels wide and it contains the image.
        The div element will float to the right. Margins are added to the div to push the text away from the div.
        Borders and padding are added to the div to frame in the picture and the caption.
    </p>

    <!-- An image with border and margins that floats to the right in a paragraph -->
    <p>In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. A dotted black border is added to the image.
        We have also added margins to the image to push the text away from the image:
        0 px margin on the top and right side, 15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side of the
        image.
