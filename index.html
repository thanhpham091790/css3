    <!-- An image with border and margins that floats to the right in a paragraph -->
    <p>In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. A dotted black border is added to the image.
        We have also added margins to the image to push the text away from the image:
        0 px margin on the top and right side, 15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side of the
        image.

    <!-- A simple use of the float property -->
    <p>In the paragraph below, we have added an image with style <b>float:right</b>. The result is that the image will
        float to the right in the paragraph.</p>
