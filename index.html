        <!-- How to position a background image -->
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>W3Schools background no-repeat, set position example.</p>
        <p>Now the background image is only shown once, and positioned away from the text.</p>
        <p>In this example we have also added a margin on the right side, so the background image will never disturb the text.</p>
