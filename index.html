    <!-- Create floating boxes -->
    <h2>Grid of Boxes</h2>
    <p>Float boxes side by side:</p>

    <div class="clearfix">
        <div class="box" style="background-color:#bbb">
            <p>Some text inside the box.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" style="background-color:#ccc">
            <p>Some text inside the box.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" style="background-color:#ddd">
            <p>Some text inside the box.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Note that we also use the clearfix hack to take care of the layout flow, and that add the box-sizing property to
        make sure that the box doesn't break due to extra padding. Try to remove this code to see the effect.</p>

    <!-- Turn off float (using the clearfix hack) -->
    <p>In this example, the image is taller than the element containing it, and it is floated, so it overflows outside
        of its container:</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Without Clearfix</h2>
        <img class="img1" src="https://www.w3schools.com/css/pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum...
    </div>

    <p style="clear:right">Add the clearfix hack to the containing element, to fix this problem:</p>

    <div class="clearfix">
        <h2>With Clearfix</h2>
        <img class="img2" src="https://www.w3schools.com/css/pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum...
    </div>

    <!-- Turn off float (using the clear property) -->
    <h2>Without clear</h2>
    <div class="div1">div1</div>
    <div class="div2">div2 - Notice that the div2 element is after div1, in the HTML code. However, since div1 is
        floated to the left, this happens: the text in div2 is floated around div1, and div2 surrounds the whole thing.
    </div>

    <h2>Using clear</h2>
    <div class="div3">div3</div>
    <div class="div4">div4 - Using clear moves div4 down below the floated div3. The value "left" clears elements
        floated to the left. You can also clear "right" and "both".</div>
    <!-- Let the first letter of a paragraph float to the left -->
    <p>
        <span>T</span>his is some text.

    </p>

    <p>
        In the paragraph above, the first letter of the text is embedded in a span element.
        The span element has a width that is 0.7 times the size of the current font.
        The font-size of the span element is 400% (quite large) and the line-height is 80%.
        The font of the letter in the span will be in "Algerian".

    <div>

    </p>

    <p>
        In the paragraph above, the div element is 120 pixels wide and it contains the image.
        The div element will float to the right. Margins are added to the div to push the text away from the div.
        Borders and padding are added to the div to frame in the picture and the caption.
    </p>

    <!-- An image with border and margins that floats to the right in a paragraph -->
    <p>In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. A dotted black border is added to the image.
        We have also added margins to the image to push the text away from the image:
        0 px margin on the top and right side, 15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side of the
        image.

    <!-- A simple use of the float property -->
    <p>In the paragraph below, we have added an image with style <b>float:right</b>. The result is that the image will
        float to the right in the paragraph.</p>
